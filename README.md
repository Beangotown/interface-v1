# BeanGoTown

## Introduction

BeanGo Town is a game built on the AELF blockchain. Inspired by Monopoly. Users need to obtain the NFT to start the game. Click the GO button to roll the dice to determine the number of steps to move, and receive corresponding point rewards based on the location the piece lands on after the move.

- The game supports multiple ways to log in or register (Web2/Web3).
- The BeanPass NFT required to play the game can be collected directly in the game.
- The number of points rolled in the game is determined by random numbers generated on the chain.

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### Install dependencies

If `yarn` is not available [install](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install) it first.

```bash
yarn
```

### Starting the local development server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Runs the app on [aelf's testnet](https://explorer-test.aelf.io/) in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any linting errors in the console.

### Building the application for production

```
yarn build
```

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the each of the filenames includes the hash of their content.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Starting the application in production

```
yarn start
```

Runs the app at [aelf's mainnet](https://explorer.aelf.io/).
Start the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with `yarn build or npm run build` first.

## Rewrite Config

Rewrites allow you to map an incoming request path to a different destination path.
Configure the following rewrite paths in `build.config/rewrite/test.js`:

```js
module.exports = [
	{
		source: '/connect/:path*',
		destination: 'https://auth-portkey-test.portkey.finance/connect/:path*',
	},
	{
		source: '/portkey/:path*',
		destination: 'https://did-portkey-test.portkey.finance/:path*',
	},
	{
		source: '/api/:path*',
		destination: 'https://test.beangotown.com/api/:path*',
	},
	{
		source: '/cms/:path*',
		destination: 'https://test-cms.beangotown.com/:path*',
	},
	{
		source: '/AElfIndexer_DApp/PortKeyIndexerCASchema/:path*',
		destination: 'http://192.168.67.51:8083/AElfIndexer_DApp/PortKeyIndexerCASchema/:path*',
	},
	{
